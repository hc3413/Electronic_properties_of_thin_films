# Electronic_properties_of_thin_films
Hall and resitivity measurments to determine the mobility and carrier density in thin films. 
In the main part for Van der Pauw geometry measurments on the PPMS.
Extracts data, combines measurements to remove offsets and plots results giving resistivity and mobility of materials.
